      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Karen and Puddin-cropped.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Information technology has been my career for 20+ years.  I was recruited
                 out of college by EDS - getting my feet wet in the industry as an SED
                 (Systems Engineer Development program).  Soon after I became a Programmer/Analyst
                 and have progressed into various roles including Development Team Lead, 
                 Senior Systems Analyst, Senior Business Analyst, Senior Project Manager (PMP)
                 and Certified Scrum Master (CSM) - engaged with large consulting firms
                 including Perot Systems, AT&T and IBM.

                 My education includes a Bachelor of Science Computer Information Systems from 
                 DeVry Institute of Technology and a Master of Science Digital Forensics from the
                 University of Central Florida.  I have also completed the University of Central
                 Florida's Full Stack Developer coding bootcamp.
